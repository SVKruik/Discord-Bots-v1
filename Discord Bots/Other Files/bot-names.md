# MultiCube - Bot Names

----------------------------------------

Our Discord server has a couple of bots. The EGS names are named after birds, in Latin. The MCC bots are named after trees. Because we are a Dutch community, we also added their Dutch names. Afer their names, we also listed their purposes.
